# WebAuthn

A suite of specifications and standards related to
browser-based authentication.

FIDO rebranded.

---

# Passkeys

The subset of WebAuthn that's implemented\* and works.

WebAuthn rebranded.

---

# Demo

<https://passkeys.js.org>

---

# The Magic‚Ñ¢

```js
let Passkeys = globalThis.navigator?.credentials;
```

```js
let passkey = await Passkeys.create(createOpts);

let passkey = await Passkeys.get(requestOpts);

void passkeys.get(autofillOptions).then(eventHandler);
```

# Context of Passkeys

- Stronger Authentication for You
- More Convenient for Your Customers
- Single Factor
- One-to-Many
- A Common\* Subset

\* <small>Apple, Brave, Google, Firefox, Microsoft, YubiCo,
etc</small>

## Platform Support

- MDN [Baseline‚Ñ¢](https://caniuse.com/webauthn) Browser
  Support
  - Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari,
  - Android Browser, UC Browser, WebViews
- Universal Platform Support
  - Android, Chrome OS, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows
  - iCloud, Google Sync, Microsoft... _thingy_ (?)

## _Closer_ to the Metal

Maybe you're better off learning than off-loading.

---

## ... but not _the Metal_

Use abstractions to avoid confusion or _intense_ tedium.

---

## Can you use Passkeys without a Library?

---

# No.

<small>(well, maybe)</small>

> The subset of WebAuthn that's implemented\* and works.

\*: some tedious but critical assembly required

also \*: most of WebAuthn will _never_ be implemented

# Passkeys Vocabulary

| Term       | Meaning                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Passkey\*  | generally "the implementation", of WebAuthn |
| Authc      | Authenticator, the Device or Platform       |
| Platform   | the browser, OS, plugin, or service         |
| Credential | Public Key (`P-256` or `ed25519`)           |
| Assertion  | signed server-side challenge (salt)         |
| Challenge  | a server-side nonce                         |
| Nonce      | arbitrary single-use data, such as a salt   |
| Salt       | random bytes, to make a hash unpredictable  |

## On to the Implementation

---

## Platform & Autofill Support

```js
let passkeyCredential = globalThis.PublicKeyCredential;

let hasPlatformSupport =
  await passkeyCredential?.isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable();

let hasAutofillSupport =
  await passkeyCredential?.isConditionalMediationAvailable();
```

```js
let passkeySupport =
  hasPlatformSupport && hasAutofillSupport;
```

---

### No Platform, No Autofill, No Service

Just Say No üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<small>diminishing returns on stuff your mom will never
know</small>

---

# What are Passkeys?

- Credential Registration (`webauthn.create`)
- Credential Authentication (`webauthn.get`)
  - (also called `assertion`, which is an overloaded term)

---

# Caveats

---

## Unsupportable Features

These will probably _never_ be supported:

- passive / background / silent authentication
- cross-origin authentication

<small>unlikely that _all_ vendors will agree</small>

---

## Good Key Types:

- ‚úÖ ECDSA `P-256` (a.k.a. `ES256`, `prime256v1`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è EdDSA `ed25519`
  ([caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_subtlecrypto_sign_ed25519))

---

## Bad Key Types

- ‚ùå RSA
- ‚ùå ECDSA `P-256k` (a.k.a. `secp256k1`)
- ‚ùå the other 200+ types
